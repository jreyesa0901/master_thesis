TODO 
The main purpose of the thesis would be to have a result. >> More practical approach.


High Priority
	What are the Binary models
	REcurrent neural network
	Check the characteristics of LSTM
	
	Write a goal, a description and share it on the presentation.
		Edge device is the name that has to be given such that it is also flexible.
	
	Check the charactersitis of the K210 hardware accelerator (Python capable)

	Check the characteristics of GRU
	Understand what are the goals for inference stage in machine learning (ONLY)
		Inference Models

	Read the documentation
	Check the characteristics of the hardware that was given.

	No handling of commands.

Draft to Turau's Msg



	
Current state

SPECIFIC NOTES:

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used in speech recognition and natural language 
processing applications because of their capability to process temporal sequences. Because 
RNNs are fully connected, they require a large number of weight memory accesses, leading 
to high power consumption.


I would like to share the goal proposal according to what was talked the last meeting.
Goal: Port a LTS RNN for speech recognition to a edge device with a plan to be integrated 
	in an industrial robot.

Focused on inference process as the training has already been approached in 
		earlier stages of the project
Main tasks:
	Evaluating the portability cost due to its "high power consumption"
	Selection of hardware, advantages and disadvantages regarding expertise and open-source tools
		FPGA vs ARM architectures and NN Compilers
	Backend optimization through usage of open source projects // if possible
	Physycal integration prototype with the selected HW
	Validation and report of results
	
Current resources that I find helpful divided in three fieds and prioritized:
Generalities:

	Speech recognition RNNs (Mainly during this week)
	2017 08 Gate-variants of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks
	For understanding of GRU and its relation to RNN
2019 08 Performance Evaluation of Deep Neural Networks Applied to Speech Recognition: RNN, LSTM and GRU
	Understanding the speech recognition oriented NNs
	
	Hardware Optimization (mainlz FPGA cases)
	
	2020 09 EdgeDRNN: Enabling Low-latency Recurrent Neural Network Edge Inference
	For depth understanding of the GRU? Model??
	For depth understanding of Edge FPGAs
	Could this model be ported to ARM processors? Is this needed?
	How this RNN outperforms the GPUs
	
	NN Compilers for IR and Backend optimization

I would propose another quick meeting to discuss my proposed goal and its feasability.
ALong with especific questions that might come up during this week.

Specific question: If the datasheet of the mic array can be shared with me.



Message to Hendrik

Hello Hendrik,

After Friday's meeting could basically ensured the extension of the contact?

I ask this because of my willing for having a copy of the contract in this or next week, 
as long as it is possible. So I would really appreciate your feedback regarding this topic.


Message to new professor Heiko and other.

Inference models

Hey mira 

Written in python Maicrav precise-- TensorFlow Lite / LSTM / GRU // 
LSTM <<< 

1. Binary Raspberry Pi


Inference  already trained by Milat

Model KBs ---  20 Neurons

--------------------------- Binary models
REcurrent neural network
Only Inference >>>

K210 Python >>>  
------

2. handle of commands


Mention only to run edge device, to have flexibility


Priorities of the tasks for different processors (multi-processors).
