	Attacking hardware instead of software
	
	Clock glitching?
	
	Nailgun Attack --- Bleeding Gbig Malicious bluetookt low energy packets processed by Texas instruments
	
	Hardware attack ROI is high?? Attackers are doing that in HARDware instead of Software
	
	
	Security depends on a SOC configuration not only on the IPs
	
	Memory protection unit MPU misconfiguration
	
	Programming error in on-chip ... bus access
	
	What is HSDL??
	system verilog assertions?
	System level security verigication ?? pentetration testing
	
	Challange . Verification requires design signals instead of natural language
	
	Testcases not scalable and focuses only on known issues
	
	CWE --- a list of weaknesses that can lead to vulnerabilites, it is growing in hardware
	
	
	To asses the importance of security, the consequences need to be studied
